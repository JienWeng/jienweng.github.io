# About

<!-- under the supervision of [Ir. Ts. Gs. Dr. Chow Ming Fai](https://www.monash.edu.my/engineering/about-us/all-staff/civil-engineering/ap-dr-chow-ming-fai) -->

I'm a Research Assistant at [Monash University Malaysia](https://www.monash.edu.my). I obtained my BSc. in Applied Mathematics from [Tunku Abdul Rahman University (UTAR)](https://www.utar.edu.my). My research is motivated by the reinforcement learning advancements in attention-based predictive models. I believe that soon the current LLM would reach a point where it hardly improves, and the next gap to filled in is experience. Also, I'm currently working on quantitative finance on both TradFi and DeFi, feel free to discuss.

Beyond academics, I'm currently working on several web development projects, and actively providing college-level mathematics and public speaking tutoring.
